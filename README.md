You can extend collections to return the element at the specified index if it is within bounds, otherwise nil.

```swift
extension Collection {
    subscript (safe index: Index) -> Element? {
        return indices.contains(index) ? self[index] : nil
    }
}

let cars = ["Lexus", "Ford", "Volvo", "Toyota", "Opel"]
let selectedCar1 = cars[safe: 3] // Toyota
let selectedCar2 = cars[safe: 6] // not crash, but nil
```
